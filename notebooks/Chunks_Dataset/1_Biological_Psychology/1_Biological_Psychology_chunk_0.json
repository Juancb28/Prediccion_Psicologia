  "text": "It is often said that Man is unique among animals. It is worth looking at this term unique before we discuss our subject proper. The word may in this context have two slightly different meanings. It may mean: Man is strikingly different - he is not identical with any animal. This is of course true. It is true also of all other animals: Each species, even each individual is unique in this sense. But the term is also often used in a more absolute sense: Man is so different, so \"essentially different\" (whatever that means) that the gap between him and animals cannot possibly be bridged - he is something altogether new. \nUsed in this absolute sense the term is scientifically meaningless. Its use also reveals and may reinforce conceit, and it leads to complacency and defeatism because it assumes that it will be futile even to search for animal roots. It is prejudging the issue.\n\nModule 1\n\nModule 1.1 The Biological Approach to Behavior \n\nSo how did that happen? Furthermore, given the existence of a universe, why this particular type of universe? As Steven Vigdor noted, \"Our universe is habitable. It did not have to be so.\" The Big Bang that started the universe contained an as-yet unexplained asymmetry that caused the development of more matter than antimatter. If matter and antimatter had been equal, there could be no stars, planets, or anything else. Our universe has protons, neutrons, and electrons with particular imensions of mass and charge. It has four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.",
