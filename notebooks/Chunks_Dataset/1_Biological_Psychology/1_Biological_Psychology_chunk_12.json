  "text": "restrictions prevent certain kinds of research on humans. Investigators sometimes insert electrodes into the brains of rats and other animals to determine the relationship between brain activity and behavior. They also inject chemicals, extract brain chemicals, and study the effects of brain damage. Such experiments answer questions that investigators cannot address in any other way, including some questions that are critical for medical progress. However, they do raise an ethical issue: When a research study is unacceptable with humans, is it acceptable with other species? If so, under what circumstances?\n\nResearch raises no objections when investigators simply observe how animal behavior varies as a function of times of day, seasons of the year, changes in diet, and so forth. In other studies, however, including many discussed in this book, animals have been subjected to procedures that are clearly harmful to them. Anyone with a conscience, including scientists, is distressed by this fact. Nevertheless, experimentation with animals has been critical to the medical research that led to methods for the prevention or treatment of polio, diabetes, measles, smallpox, massive burns, heart disease, and other serious conditions. Retinal implants to alleviate blindness and cochlear implants for hearing loss began with animal research. Progress toward treating or preventing AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and other disorders depends largely on animal research. In much of medicine and biological psychology, research would progress slowly or not at all without animals.\n\nDegrees of Opposition\n\nOpposition to animal research ranges in degree.",
