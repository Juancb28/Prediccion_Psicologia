  "text": "milar regulations and committees govern research on human subjects. In addition, research laboratories must abide by national laws requiring standards of cleanliness and animal care. Scientific journals accept publications only after researchers state that they followed all the laws and regulations. Professional organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience publish guidelines for the use of animals in research (refer to Appendix B). Rules differ from one country to another. For example, research on treatments for Ebola, Zika, and other viruses requires studies on monkeys, but political pressures in the United States and Europe block nearly all such research, leaving the world to rely on researchers in China, where the government is more permissive.\n\nIn contrast to “minimalists,” the “abolitionists” find no room for compromise. Abolitionists maintain that all animals have the same rights as humans. They regard killing an animal as murder, regardless of whether the intention is to eat it, use its fur, or gain scientific knowledge. Keeping an animal in a cage (presumably even a pet) is, in their view, slavery. Because animals cannot give informed consent to research, abolitionists insist it is wrong to use them in any way, regardless of the circumstances. According to one opponent of animal research, “We have no moral option but to bring this research to a halt. Completely.... We Will not be satisfied until every cage is empty” (Regan, 1986, pp. 39–40). Advocates of this position sometimes claim that most animal research is painful and that it never leads to important results. However, for a true abolitionist, neither of those points matters.",
