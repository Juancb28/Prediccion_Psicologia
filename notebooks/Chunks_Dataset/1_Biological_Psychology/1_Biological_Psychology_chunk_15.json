  "text": "rch to a halt. Completely.... We Will not be satisfied until every cage is empty” (Regan, 1986, pp. 39–40). Advocates of this position sometimes claim that most animal research is painful and that it never leads to important results. However, for a true abolitionist, neither of those points matters. Their moral imperative is that people have no right to use animals at all, even if the research is highly useful and totally painless.\n\nThe disagreement between abolitionists and animal researchers is a dispute between two ethical positions: “Never knowingly harm an innocent” and “Sometimes a little harm leads to a greater good.” On the one hand, permitting research has the undeniable consequence of inflicting pain or distress. On the other hand, banning all use of animals would mean a great setback in medical research as well as the end of animal-to-human transplants (e.g., transplanting pig heart valves to prolong lives of people with heart diseases). Medical researchers and brain researchers would welcome the day when they can do without animal research, but that day is not at hand.\n\nIt would be nice to say that this ethical debate has always proceeded in an intelligent and mutually respectful way. Unfortunately, it has not. Over the years, abolitionists have sometimes advanced their cause through intimidation. Examples include vandalizing laboratories, placing a bomb under a professor’s car, placing a bomb on a porch (intended for a researcher but accidentally placed on the neighbor’s porch), banging on a researcher’s children’s windows at night, and inserting a garden hose through a researcher’s window to flood the house.",
