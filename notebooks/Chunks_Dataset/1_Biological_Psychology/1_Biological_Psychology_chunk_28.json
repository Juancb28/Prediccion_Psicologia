Kill me and save the others.”\n\nThis plan works well if the virus-infected cell is a skin cell or a blood cell, which the body replaces easily. However, with almost no exceptions, the vertebrate brain cannot replace damaged neurons. You can’t afford to sacrifice brain cells because of a viral infection. To minimize the risk, the body lines the brain’s blood vessels with tightly packed cells that keep out most viruses and bacteria.\n\nUnfortunately, a few viruses do cross the blood–brain barrier. What happens then? The brain’s microglia attack most viruses that enter the nervous system, mounting an inflammatory response that fights the virus without killing the neuron. However, this response controls the virus without eliminating it. The spirochete responsible for syphilis can penetrate the blood–brain barrier, producing long-lasting and potentially fatal consequences if it is not properly treated. When the chicken pox virus enters spinal cord cells, virus particles remain there long after they have been exterminated from the rest of the body. The virus may emerge decades later, causing a painful condition called shingles. Similarly, the virus responsible for genital herpes hides in the nervous system, producing little harm there but periodically emerging to cause new genital infections.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus crosses the blood–brain barrier in mice, although we do not yet know about humans (Rhea et al., 2021). We do know that some people infected with that virus develop seizures, confusion (“brain fog”), or impairments of vision, taste, and smell.",
