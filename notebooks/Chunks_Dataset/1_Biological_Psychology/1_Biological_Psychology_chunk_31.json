  "text": "Because metabolizing glucose requires oxygen, neurons need a steady supply of oxygen. Although the human brain constitutes only about 2 percent of the body’s weight, it uses about 20 percent of its oxygen and 25 percent of its glucosa.\n\nGlucose shortage is rarely a problem, except during starvation. The liver makes glucose from many kinds of carbohydrates and amino acids, as well as from glycerol, a breakdown product from fats. A more likely problem is an inability to use glucose. To use glucose, the body needs vitamin B1, thiamine. Prolonged thiamine deficiency, common in chronic alcoholism, leads to death of neurons and a condition called Korsakoff’s syndrome, marked by memory impairments.\n\nOther Cells: The Gut Bacteria\n\nAnother influence on your behavior comes from cells that are not really you, genetically. They are “guests” in your body—the bacteria in your gut. It is difficult to get an accurate count of the number of cells in your body or the number of bacteria in your intestines—and, anyway, not worth the bother—but the best estimate is that the numbers are about equal, a one-to-one ratio, within the error of measurement.\n\nYour gut bacteria include many species, which vary from person to person. Bacteria influence brain activity in several ways. One way is to stimulate the vagus nerve, which runs from the intestines to the brain. Another is to release chemicals that cross the lining of the intestines and enter the blood. Those chemicals include vitamins and amino acids, but they can also include chemicals that cause inflammation. The amount and type of chemicals that bacteria release affect your mood and motivations, including your motivations for food, sex, socialization, and abused drugs.",
