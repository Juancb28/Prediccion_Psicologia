The amount and type of chemicals that bacteria release affect your mood and motivations, including your motivations for food, sex, socialization, and abused drugs.\n\nStress increases the type of bacteria that cause inflammation and mitochondrial damage. People with depression tend to have more of those bacteria, as well as less of the bacteria with anti-inflammatory effects (Chen and Vitetta, 2020; Jiang et al., 2015). Some antidepressant drugs attack bacteria. Given that people with depression have many inflammatory bacteria, attacking them can be beneficial. However, it is not a good idea to get rid of too many of your intestinal bacteria. Removing most or all bacteria causes an increase in anxiety and depression. When people take antibiotics to attack bacteria, the side effects often include depression and anxiety. “Probiotics” are diet supplements that contain “good” bacteria, and some authorities recommend them as part of a treatment program for depression.\n\nModule 1.3 The Action Potential\n\nAlthough the axon’s method of transmitting an impulse prevents a touch on your shoulder from feeling stronger than one on your toes, it introduces a different problem: Because axons transmit information at moderate speeds (varying from less than 1 meter/second to more than 100 m/s), a touch on your shoulder reaches your brain sooner than does a touch on your toes. The difference is small and generally unimportant.\n\nIn vision, however, your brain needs to know whether one stimulus began even slightly before or after another one.",
