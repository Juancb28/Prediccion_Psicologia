  "text": "chologists' trying to understand what is going on \nin the mind of the individual engaging in the \nbehavior. \nHowever, Tolman and subsequent behaviorist \nresearchers noted the role of cognitive processes \nin influencing behavior. A convergence of developments across many fields led to the emergence \nof cognitive psychology as a discrete discipline, \nspearheaded by such notables as Neisser. \nHow have other disciplines contributed to the \ndevelopment of theory and research in cognitive \npsychology? \nCognitive psychology has roots in \nphilosophy and physiology. They merged to form \nthe mainstream of psychology. As a discrete field \nof psychological study, cognitive psychology also \nprofited from cross-disciplinary investigations. \nRelevant fields include linguistics (e.g., How \ndo language and thought interact?), biological \npsychology (What are the physiological bases \nfor cognition?), anthropology (What is the importance of the cultural context for cognition?), and technological advances like artificial \nintelligence (How do computers process in \nformation ?) . \n5. What methods do cognitive psychologists use to \nstudy how people think? \nCognitive psychologists use a broad range of methods, including \nexperiments, psychobiological techniques, self \nreports, case studies, naturalistic observation, and \ncomputer simulations and artificial intelligence. \n6. What are the current issues and various fields of \nstudy within cognitive psychology? \nSome of \nthe major issues in the field have centered on how \nto pursue knowledge. Psychological work can be \ndone:\n by using both rationalism (which is the basis for \ntheory development) and empiricism (which is \nthe basis for gathering data); \n by underscoring the importance of cognitive \nstructures and of cognitive processes;",
