  "text": "e field have centered on how \nto pursue knowledge. Psychological work can be \ndone:\n by using both rationalism (which is the basis for \ntheory development) and empiricism (which is \nthe basis for gathering data); \n by underscoring the importance of cognitive \nstructures and of cognitive processes; \n by emphasizing the study of domain-general \nand of domain-specific processing; \n by striving for a high degree of experimental \ncontrol (which better permits causal inferences) \nand for a high degree of ecological validity (which \nbetter allows generalization of findings to set \ntings outside of the laboratory); \n by conducting basic research seeking funda \nmental insights about cognition and applied \nresearch seeking effective uses of cognition in \nreal-world settings. \nAlthough positions on these issues may ap \npear to be diametrical opposites, often apparently \nantithetical views may be synthesized into a form \nthat offers the best of each of the opposing view \npoints. \nCognitive psychologists study biological bases \nof cognition as well as attention, consciousness, \nperception, memory, mental imagery, language, \nproblem solving, creativity, decision making, reasoning, developmental changes in cognition \nacross the life span, human intelligence, artificial \nintelligence, and various other aspects of human \nthinking.",
